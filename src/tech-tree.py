chia cat tech tree demo
an attempt to create comprehensive tech tree using CATs (Chia asset tokens) as 
the prequeisits for each level




ie
sources 

spear blueprint + wood + stone = compeleted spear + spear blue print

here is the questions as there different cats to be created for each type 
so far I think
BLUEP = blueprint cat <- recreated after sucessful spend
COMPNT = component cat  <- destroied on sucessful spend but can only be spent with blueprint type 
COMPITM = completed item cat which can be used elseware like a weapon to arm troops 
            or used to create new items with correct blueprint 
RESOURCE CAT = source for components


BLUEP
Sucessful spend Requires: 
2 or 3 component cats of the correct type
+ 1 completed item cat


Creates:
Recreates itself to show knowledge is leant
Creates Completed item
any remainder components returned to wallet
